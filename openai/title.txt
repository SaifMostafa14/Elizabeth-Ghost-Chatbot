The
prince
AuthorsNiccolò Machiavelli 1469-1527,(Author)W K Marriott (William K.),(Translator)Mitch Horowitz(Writer of introduction)
eBook2019Original classic edition.
New York : G & D Media, 2019.
Summary"The
Prince" is a treatise by statesman Niccolo Machiavelli. It was written in the Middle Ages, and published only after the death of the author. In it, Niccolo Machiavelli combines all the experience of managing the state, sharing his thoughts with readers. Although this book is largely instructive, it is not perceived as such. When you read, there is no feeling of boredom or the fact that an opinion is imposed on you with which you do not agree. The author enables readers to draw conclusions themselves. In the book you can see discussions about power and how to achieve it; these thoughts are concise and simple. In just a few theses, the author provides arguments confirming his point of view, drawing on the experience of past years.

The
prince : the secret story of the world's most intriguing royal,
prince Bandar bin Sultan
AuthorsWilliam Simpson 1948-Nelson Mandela 1918-2013,(Writer of foreword.)Margaret Thatcher(Writer of foreword.)
Print Book©20061st ed.
New York : Regan Books, ©2006.
SummaryA riveting portrait of one of the most enigmatic yet influential powerbrokers in America -
Prince Bandar bin Sultan bin Abdul Aziz Al-Saud, the Saudi Arabian Ambassador to the United States from 1983 to 2005. For the last two and a half decades, the United States and Saudi Arabia have had a very special relationship - through war, oil crises, and global terrorism. At a time when understanding our friends is as important as knowing our enemies, understanding
Bandar bin Sultan may be the key to figuring out the Saudis. As the illegitimate son of a Saudi
and a servant girl,
Bandar overcame his unrecognized beginnings to rise through the ranks of the Royal Saudi Air Force. Through his work with President Carter on the sale of F-15s to Saudi Arabia and his vital behind-the-scenes help in getting the Panama Canal Treaty through Congress, Bandar became one of Saudi Arabiaʼs brightest diplomatic stars - leading to his appointment as the Ambassador to the United States. As Ambassador, Bandar worked with President Reagan and CIA Director Bill Casey to win the Cold War with Saudi petrodollars. Seemingly in the thick of some of the most important world events of the last twenty-five years, Bandar played a key role in the Iran-Contra affair; convinced President Gorbachev to withdraw the Soviet military from Afghanistan; and negotiated an end to the Iran-Iraq war among others. A Machiavellian manipulator and a master tactician on the global chessboard, Bandar has had unmatched access to the Oval Office. George H.W. Bush took The
and his family fishing; Nancy Reagan used him to convey messages to her husbandʼs Cabinet; Colin Powell would drop by to play racquetball. During the Gulf War,
Bandar even became a de facto member of the National Security Council. In this biography, William Simpson pulls back the curtain for the first time on the fascinating and startling life of a man of contradictions - equally at home in the royal palace in Riyadh as on the ski slopes of Aspen or playing hardball politics with international heads of state; a super-wealthy playboy yet a devoted family man; an expert in subterfuge and misdirection, yet a straight talker trusted the world over; a man of peace and yet the biggest arms dealer in the world - who emerged throughout the 1980s and ʼ90s as one of the driving forces behind American foreign policy. -- Book jacket.

The History of Mary
Prince, a West Indian Slave : Related by Herself
AuthorsMary
Prince
eBook2017DocSouth books edition.
Chapel Hill : University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Library, 2017.
SummaryMary
Prince's narrative was one of the earliest to reveal the ugly truths about slavery in the West Indies to an English reading public that was largely unaware of its atrocities.
Prince was born in Bermuda to an enslaved family. She spent her early life in harsh conditions and was eventually sold to John Adams Wood of Antigua, working as his domestic servant. She joined the Moravian Church, where she learned to read, and married Daniel James, a former slave who had bought his freedom. In 1828 she traveled to England with the Woods family and after protracted efforts by abolitionists was able to leave their control. Encouraged by her new employer, Thomas Pringle, who also served as her editor,
wrote and published her book in 1831 to wide acclaim. While eighteenth-century slave narratives largely focused on Christian spiritual journeys and religious redemption,
was part of a growing trend of abolitionist writers focused on the injustice of slavery. Her work stands alongside better-known narratives such as A Narrative of the Adventures and Escape of Moses Roper and Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass. Adding to its importance, few early women's slave narratives exist.

The history of Mary
Prince : a West Indian slave
AuthorsMary
Prince(Author)Sara Salih(Editor)
Print Book2000
London ; New York : Penguin Books, 2000.
Summary"Mary
Prince recalls that in the slave market in Bermuda, where she was put up for sale, the buyers' talk 'fell like cayenne on the fresh wounds of our hearts'. During her life as a slave she was taken from Bermuda to Turks Island and Antigua, eventually arriving in London where, in 1828, she reported the cruelty of her master and mistress to the Anti-Slavery Society." "The History of Mary
(1831) was the first life of a black woman to be published in Britain. This testament of ill-treatment and survival was a protest and a rallying-cry for emancipation that provoked two libel actions and ran into three editions in the year of its publication." "This edition includes an introduction which discusses The History within the context of black writing, explanatory notes, a chronology, and supplementary material on enslavement and the case of Mary
."--Jacket.
